# PCA-Exercise

To speed up a classification algorithm on a high-dimensional dataset, PCA is applied. In this exercise, I will fit a model on the original scaled data, and a different one on data after transformation using a PCA model. At the end, I will compare the computation time and the evaluation scores.
